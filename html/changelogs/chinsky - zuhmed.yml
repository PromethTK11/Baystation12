changes: 
  - rscadd: "Beeg medical changes. Like holy crap. Get a crash course on https://wiki.baystation12.net/index.php?title=Zuhmed_Guide"
  - rscadd: "Death now occurs when brain dies. Brain's health replaces overall 'health'"
  - rscadd: "Death is now FINAL, baring relacing. Don't let that brain die."
  - rscadd: "Crit now exists as flatlining, the heart failure, or as fancily 'asystole'. It happens when heart is damaged, not enough blood or oxygen in blood, or high levels of shock."
  - rscadd: "In crit you do the usual gasping thing and take brain damage. USE CRP or defib to revive em. If they die before you crack ribs, you hadn't tried hard enough."
  - rscadd: "'Toxins' damage is now overall organ failure, basically sum of organ damage. Poisons will try to destroy liver and kidney first, and will damage the rest after those two are down. Some poisons go straight for vitals. Liver will heal self until it's too damaged."
  - rscadd: "'Suffocation' damage is now used as modifier to your blood levels. If you don't get enough air, you get effects of low blood basically."
  - rscadd: "Defibs now restart failed hearts instead of reviving dead. Also named differently now."
  - rscadd: "Most scanner readouts are changed now. Instead of damage values they report vitals (pulse/blood pressure/brain activity) and general state of damage."
  - rscadd: "A D R E N A L I N E. When you take a good chunk of damage at once (15 or more in one hit) you generate bit of adrenaline reagent according to damage taken. It acts like strong painkiller / pulse raiser for a tick or two, becoming weaker after that."
  - rscadd: "FBPs and IPCs now have batteries in their chests. They have HYPERCELLS and drain when they stand (unbuckled) or move around (double drain then)."
  - rscadd: "Sleepers now have stomach pumps, same as filtering but for ingested stuff."
  - rscadd: "Cultists yo - sacrifice rune now works on someone in asystole rather than full braindeath. Knives now count for all steps needed to cut out the heart, and cult runes count as surgery spots. Just sayin'."
  - rscadd: "Bunch of chems is different now. First off, none 'reduce' toxins damage, aside from peridaxon cause tht's organ damage now."
  - rscadd: "Peridaxon only treats brain damage if it's not too severe. Get Alkysine otherwise."
  - rscadd: "Alkysine will only work if brain is fully oxygenated, so refill blood and air first."
  - rscadd: "Dylovene removes toxic reagents from blood."
  - rscadd: "Dexlaine fools brain into thinking you got at least 50% of air you needed. For Dex+ it's 80%."
  - rscadd: "Cryox/Clonex also have Dex/Dex+ effect respectively."
  - rscadd: "Inapro prevents suffocating while in asystole, slows pulse down (which slows bleeding a bit) and has mild painkiller effect as it did."
