/*
Tajaran frontflip proof of concept

Design:

1) Using the inherent verbs, we'll create a proc that will be added to the Taajran
2) This allows him to move 3 squares in front of where he's facing, he'll be able to jump over determinate dense objects in the whole trajectory
3) Can crash against walls and dense objects by checking if a dense object or a dense turf is in it's way, if it is, it'll stop in the tile before it.

Possibilites:

1- Backflips too.
